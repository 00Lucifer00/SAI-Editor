- Implement user-controlled SAI templates which can also be shared between users and possibly uploaded somewhere
- Functionality to check for 'wrong' code; reads selected line for stuff like unused parameters having values, wrong comments, incorrect use of parameters, etc. etc
- Checkbox to only show event_types and action_types for the chosen source_type (so for gameobjects we would hide SMART_EVENT_SPELLHIT, etc.)
- Implement a SQLite database containing required tables for the tool (creature_template, creature, gameobject, smart_scripts, quest_template, item_template, etc.) and use this if user wants to not use his local database
  - Make this a download option instead (?). The SQLite file would become over 100 MB if we'd do this and it'd make no sense if we'd never use the data.
- Implement creature_text support
- Add support to add specific flags to the source. If you for example want a creature to have a gossip, the npcflag also needs to be set accordingly. No idea yet on how to implement this in a good looking way
- Add a tutorial to the application
- Setting to control the comment generating (rules to follow and whatnot)
- Take a look into reloading the smart_scripts table (thus executing the `.reload smart` GM command in-game or in the console) from the application.

- Functionality to check for 'wrong' code; reads selected line for stuff like unused parameters having values, wrong comments, incorrect use of parameters, etc. etc;
- Checkbox if the user wants to fill in smart_scripts.id gaps;
- Read DBCs for areatriggers and implement areatrigger searching in the search form;
- Implement scripted actionlist searching in the search form;
- Possibly take the workspace-idea by Event Horizon;
- Checkbox to only show event_types and action_types for the chosen source_type (so for gameobjects we would hide SMART_EVENT_SPELLHIT, etc.);
- Change the labels of the parameter fields based on the chosen event_type, action_type and target_type (SMART_EVENT_SPELLHIT -> first param = spellid);
- Possibly pick another logo, this is fugly and boring;
- Option to reset settings to default;
- Can't use copy or paste in the numeric-only fields (entry, type id, parameters, etc.);
- The label saying 'Creature entry:' by default (changes to 'Gameobject/Areatrigger/Actionlist entry:' based on chosen source type) should say 'Creature guid:' if a guid is selected;
- Use SQLite to store contents of Spell.dbc and Areatrigger.dbc as well as information on all event, action and target parameters (one for each id) (information like tooltips, meaning of the parameter, amount of parameters, etc.);
- Clear all data to their default values when the user re-connects (contracts) to login form (source_type becomes creature, events/actions/targets become 0, etc. etc.);
- Make the column sorter work with numbers as well;
- Implement a new form for the 'Links from' and 'Links to' buttons, which lists all current events that are in the listview of the main form in a new form and allows the user to choose an event to link to or from;
- Figure out the app.config issue _properly_ (still doesn't work on a clean pull for me (Discover-));
